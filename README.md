Econometrics   1
Semester   2 2024
Subject Outline
Introduction
Welcome to ECOM 20001: Econometrics 1. In this subject, students will explore ways to use data to learn how the world works to inform. and evaluate business and government decision-making. In doing so, students will be trained in a state-of-the-art statistical program called R, which is invaluable for data analysis and in high demand in industry and government.
Subject Overview and Aims
This subject aims to introduce econometrics, which involves using data and statistical methods to estimate economic relationships, test economic theory, and predict the impact of policy. Topics include probability and statistics, single linear regression, multiple linear regression, non-linear regression, model internal and external validity, field and natural experiments, and time series models. Econometric methodology and application will be motivated and illustrated through applications to economics, accounting, finance, marketing, and management.

Private Tutoring ServicesThe   Faculty has become increasingly concerned   about the   existence   of a   number   of   private      tutoring services operating in   Melbourne that heavily target   University   of   Melbourne   students   enrolled in   FBE   subjects.
Students are urged to show caution and exercise   their   judgement   if they   are   considering   using any of these services, and   to please take   note   of the following:
Any claim by any of these businesses that they   have   a   “special”   or   “collaborative”   or   “partnership” style. relationship with the   University or Faculty   is   false and   misleading.Any claim by a private tutoring service   that   they   are   in   possession   of,   or   can   supply   you   with,   forthcoming   University exam or assignment questions or “insider” or “exclusive”   information         is also false and   misleading.
The   University has no relationship whatsoever with any of these   services   and takes   these            claims very seriously as they threaten to   damage the   University’s reputation   and   undermine   its independence.
It   is also not appropriate for students to provide   course   materials   (including   University
curricula, reading materials, exam and assignment   questions   and   answers) to   operators   of   these businesses for the purposes of allowing them to conduct   commercial   tutoring
activities.   Doing so may amount to misconduct and   will   be   taken   seriously.   Those   materials   contain intellectual property owned or controlled   by   the   University.
We encourage you to bring to the attention of   Faculty   staff any   behaviour   or   activity   that   is   not aligned with   University expectations or policy as outlined   above.

Assessment   Details
Assignments. These involve exam-type questions and data   analysis   using   R. They   can   be         submitted   individually or in groups of up to 3   (max).   Group   members   do   not   necessarily   have   to be from the same tutorial. To receive   credit for the   assignment,   all   group   members   must            have their name and student number on the   cover   page.   Students   must   confirm their
groups by 2   pm (AEST)   Friday, two weeks before   each   assignment's   due   date. After   this deadline, students not in a   confirmed   group will   submit   an   assignment   individually.
Quizzes.   Partway through each lecture, a quiz question will   be   asked to   the   class,   and   they   will   need to reply within the allocated time to earn   credit.   Each weekly   quiz   has 2   questions      (one   in each lecture), such that students will effectively   receive   a   mark   out   of 2 for   each
weekly quiz. To maximize quiz scores for students, we will add   up   scores   for   all   24questions and take the score out of 20 (with   a   max   of   100%) to   obtain   your final   quiz   grade.   Because you can miss or not complete 4   quiz   questions   without   penalty,   this   should   cover         excuses for missed quizzes except for severe medical   circumstances with   a   doctor’s   note.
Students will   be   notified before each lecture of the quiz topic   so   they   can   prepare,   and   they   will be encouraged to work   in groups   in   class to   answer the   quiz   question   for that   lecture.
Tutorials. You must attend and participate   in tutorials to   earn   your tutorial   mark   each   week.   Students only get a tutorial mark for attending the tutorial   they   are   officially   enrolled   in   (their   ‘official’ tutorial). Students with a legitimate reason   (such   as   illness) for attending   a   tutorial            other than their official one (or being unable   to   attend   any   tutorial)   can   apply   to   have   the
tutorial mark for that week transferred to the final exam by   emailing   the   tutorial   coordinator   (Mr Chin Yong Quek) their documentary evidence such as a   medical   certificate   within   a
week of missing the official tutorial.   Late requests or   requests   sent to   tutors   will   not   be   considered.   No more than two tutorial marks will be   transferred   for   any   student.
You can miss 2 tutorials without penalty throughout the   semester.   This   should   cover   all
excuses for missed tutorials except for severe medical circumstances with   a   doctor’s   note,      as mentioned above.   Please email [email   protected]   if you are   providing   a   medical   note for missing tutorials.
Final Exam. The final exam is 2 hours   in   duration   and will   involve   multiple-choice   questions   (like quiz questions),   problem-solving and econometric analyses (like   assignments   and
tutorials). An extensive exam bank from past final   exams will   be   provided to   help   students   study for the final.
Faculty Hurdle Requirement. Students must pass the final   exam to   pass   this   subject.
Assignment and Quiz Submission
Assignment submission. This is via the   LMS Assignment Submission link for all written   assignments. Assignments must be submitted by 2   pm   (AEST)   on their   due   dates.
Please   note that you must   keep a copy of your assignment   after   it   has   been   submitted,   as         you   must   be able to produce a copy at   the   request   of the teaching   staff at   any   time   after the   submission due date.
Quiz submission. All answers to quiz questions must   be submitted via   the   LMS   Quiz
Submission link. Quiz answers must   be submitted within the   allocated   time   window   within   the lecture in which a quiz question   is   asked, with   the   class working   on   it   together.   If
attending lectures virtually through a live stream, students   can   submit   their   quizzes within   the allocated quiz start and end time.   However, they will   have   less access   to   working   on         them together with other students   in   the lecture theatre.
